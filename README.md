- Copy API URL and Key ([Supabase Guide for Creating API URL and Key](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api#api-url-and-keys))
- Now open the `.env` and change the values copied from the above step

> ### Example
>
> ```
> SUPACOMMENT_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxxxxxxxxx.supabase.co
> SUPACOMMENT_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
> ```

Once you have the environment variables set, run the following command to start the build process.

```
yarn build
```

- This will create a `comments.js` & `comments.css` files under the `pubic/build` directory.

- Copy and paste the two files to root of your static website or blog.

### :pen: Usage

- To import the `comments.js` & `comments.css` file, paste the below code before `</head>` closing tag.

```html
<script src="./comments.js">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./comments.css" />
```

- Then, paste the Below code where you want to show the comments.
- Change the `yoursite.com` to your website URL. (No https:// or http:// or / at the end)
- Example: `mysupacomments.com`

```html
<div id="comments" data-url="yoursite.com" clickToLoad="false"></div>
```

- Optionally, You can set the `clickToLoad` attribute to `true` to disable autoloading of comments, the User has to click Load Comments button. (Default is `false`)

Now, If you open your static website or blog, you will see the comments section like below.
